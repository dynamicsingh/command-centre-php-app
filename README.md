# command-centre-php-app

Created this during my college days, was built around Sept 2012. I can call it my first college project. 
This is basically use for web content/url/important links management that too category wise. The code written is little raw but the app works perfectly, working on its SPA version may be releasing soon. Its been really useful for someone like me who surfs internet like anything. My personal command centre stores more than 5000 links and finding links out of it even easier than google bookmarks but yeah saving is little tedious but it serves in the long term. Will create plugin to do that in future.
